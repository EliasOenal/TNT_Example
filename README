Thumb2 Newlib Toolchain example project

This project is an example for GCC based toolchains (TNT recommended) and supports the STM32F4 Discovery Board. When successfully flashed the LEDs should start blinking. ST generously allowed me to distribute their firmware libraries with my project, yet they still are licensed under their terms. All my code is released as public domain. If you want to use the ST library you have to extract it first.

This branch has been updated to support the cube library. Due to github file size restrictions you have to manually download “STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.3.0” and extract it to this folder.
